## Language Converter (CN/EN â†’ JP + Romaji)
**Description.** A lightweight tool that converts Chinese/English text into Japanese and appends Romaji. Focuses on robust text processing (tokenization, post-edit rules, named-entity preservation) with a simple web UI for quick demos.

**Tech stack.** Next.js (TypeScript) for the frontend; FastAPI (Python) for the API. Planned: MeCab/fugashi for tokenization and romkan/custom rules for romanization. Dockerized for local dev and CI.

**Status.** In progress.
